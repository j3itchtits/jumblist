Offered (TN38) Cedar Wood Oil, Double Duvet for pets ets	Link	13/02/2010 18:37:00	15/02/2010 17:22:30	
1. 100ml Druids Keep Essential Oil: Cedar Wood
Not for undiluted use. Would prefer this to go to someone with some knowledge of
aromatherapy as quite a strong oil.

2. Had a puppy accident on our nearly new duvet which would have cost more to
have cleaned than to replace. Have cut it in two for washing which gives 2 half
duvets for pet bedding after some sewing or maybe just take out the filling for
cushions.  Unsuitable for our pup as he wants to take it apart. Should be dry
and available tomorrow.

Hi I have to offer an opened bottle of 'Floradix Floravital'  ( a herbal
vitamin tonic bought from Holland and Barret for £10)   I bought it last
week for my son. He tasted it and refused to drink any more!!  It does taste
foul but if you need a vitamin boost you're welcome to take it.

~I'm also looking for books, dvds on learning to play the piano and to learn
basic music notes.
Thanks for looking,
