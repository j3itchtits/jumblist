OFFERED: Projector
I offered this last week and was swamped in emails from people thinking it was the plug in to your DVD player or PC type. It is the old style one that needs a sheet on paper/film on the top of it. We need this gone asap please Collection from Bexhill during office hours only
Type: Offered
Keyword: Projector (Simples - Projector is the only word left after taking away "Offered")
Location: Bexhill (No postcode or location found in title string. Need to find a location name by comparing a pre-prepared list and the summary/body. The feed list needs to be tagged with a county name (maybe multiple counties). We can then get a list of towns via a web service. This list can be compared against every word in the string. Once we have a name, we can get a postcode and then a lat/long ref)

OFFERED: Glass-front display cabinet; tile spacers; ancient 8mm proj
1: cabinet, 115cm high, 30cm deep, 60cm wide, 2 glass shelves, bow-fronted with glass side panels. Made from a light wood veneer (possibly oak), curved legs. Got this from a fellow freecycler a few months back but now we've finished  ur redecorating we really don't have anywhere it can go, so if you'd like it, let me know! It's in fairly good nick with a couple of minor dinks. We haven't a key for the lock but the back comes off............... There's a pic at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/hastings-freecycle/photos/album/449887677/pic/list (you'll need to login to see it). The plant pot on top does NOT come with the cabinet! 2: an unopened pack of 250 nylon 4mm tile spacers. 3: VERY old (1930's?) Kodascope Eight Model 50R 8mm projector, lacking spools and needs a transformer to run. Ideal for an Historical society but no use at all for family films. Very good condition, would make a nice display piece. They don't go for much on eBay so don't think it's sell-onable! Pick up only, please, from Warrior Square. Cheers Malc

Taken White mugs TN38
Thanks for the prompt collection.
Type: Taken
Keyword: Mugs (If we discount "Taken" and "TN38" from the title string then we are left with "White mugs". This string then needs to be compared with a (ever-growing) list of keywords. If no match is made then the item needs to be flagged for manual intervention)
Location: TN38 (Need a regular expression that can detect a postcode (in any format) from a string)


Conclusion: Must try and get keyword/location from the title string.

Keywords: Need a massive list of keywords
Locations: Need to have a county (required), town (required), address (optional), postcode (optional), latitude (required), longtitude (required) schema.
